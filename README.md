# Ehrenfest Model
The Ehrenfest model, also known as the dog-flea model, is a statistical physics model used to describe the diffusion process, where a fixed number of particles (or "fleas") are distributed between two containers (or "dogs") and at each time step, a randomly selected particle moves from its current container to the other. This model illustrates the approach to equilibrium and is often used to demonstrate the probabilistic nature of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics.

# Results:
- The figure, presents NA (the number of fleas on 'A' dog, purple line) and NB (the number of fleas on 'B' dog, green line) as a function of time for 100 fleas.

- The figure, presents P(N) (the distribution for a number of fleas on 'A' dog) and the black line representing theoretical prediction for 100 fleas.
