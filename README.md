# Ehrenfest Model
The Ehrenfest model, also known as the dog-flea model, is a statistical physics model used to describe the diffusion process, where a fixed number of particles (or "fleas") are distributed between two containers (or "dogs") and at each time step, a randomly selected particle moves from its current container to the other. This model illustrates the approach to equilibrium and is often used to demonstrate the probabilistic nature of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics.
